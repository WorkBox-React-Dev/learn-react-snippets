# learn-react-snippets

To replicate the code for the react code snippets I have used here:

- First you need to create a project using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/).
- And then, copy the code from the snippets to your App.js file and add the respective Component.

PS: I've done this for the sake of simplicity, I have only included the necessary files i.e. App.js file and the respective Component files for each code snippet
