# Render Props
- The render props pattern just like HOC pattern helps to share common functionality between components.

- Create ClickCounter.js and HoverCounter.js in src/components with the same code as in HOC. These two components share the incrementCount functionality.
- Create User.js
- pass a prop 'name' from User Component(in App.js) and render it in User.js like `{this.props.name}`
